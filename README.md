# cookiecutter-helio
Minimalistic working django recipe for deployment on heliohost.

## Why?

I want a templated Django setup that works on heliohost.



## Usage

```
$ pip install cookiecutter
$ cookiecutter https://github.com/doismellburning/cookiecutter-django.git
```
Answer some questions and project will be ready in working directory.

See the [cookiecutter docs](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) for more information.
